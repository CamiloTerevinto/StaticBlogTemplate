# Introduction

Hi, this is my **new** blog!

I write it using the *awesome* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language!

I can also render images automatically, as long as they are in the wwwroot folder:

![Markdown logo](/images/Markdown-mark.svg.png)

Same with using the standard `img` HTML tag:

<img src="/images/Markdown-mark.svg.png" alt="Markdown logo" width="50%"/>

Bootstrap classes are also rendered:

<div class="alert alert-info">
I also support Bootstrap classes.
